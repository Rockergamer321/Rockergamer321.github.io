            <h2>Senior Queens College Student</h2>

            <p>As a student, I've been learning the building blocks necessary to be proficient and competent in the Computer Science field. That means learning about Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Web Development, Databases, etc.</p>
            <p>So far, I have a good understanding of Java, HTML, CSS, JS, and SQL</p>

            <!-- Project 1 -->
            <section class="project-item">
              <img src="images/weather.png" alt="Screenshot of Weather Application">
              <h3>Weather App</h3>
              <p>When I was first learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this was the first project that taught me how a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (as well as jQuery) was enough to create a basic website that displayed the weather in your area.</p>
              <div class="center">
                <a class="btn" href="../weather/index.html" target="_blank">Check the weather</a>

            <!-- Project 2 -->
            <section class="project-item">
              <img src="images/speed-test.png" alt="Screenshot of Typing Speed Test">
              <h3>Typing Speed Test</h3>
              <p>When learning more about JavaScript, I first learned how to create a functional clock, along with this project. I wanted to showcase this project in particular because there were more steps that I had to follow to fully incorporate all the features of this test. When I finished, I felt I had a better understanding of how JavaScript worked and I believe I have gotten better at writing JavaScript because of this project. In the process, I learned how to mark incorrect text as well as how to display, start, stop, and reset a timer. I also learned how to add leading zeros for aesthetic reasons. Check it out and put your fingers to the test.</p>

            <section class="project-item">
              <img src="images/chat-app.png" alt="The Wire Ipsum">
              <h3>Online Chat Application</h3>
              <p>After learning the basics of JavaScript, I learned more about what JavaScript has to offer, such as jQuery and AJAX. I learned a good amount of both. If I had stopped there, I would have featured my live search page that I created using AJAX. However, when I started to learn about Node.js, I was amazed to see how Node.js allowed me to create a functional chat app that could be accessed anywhere. I also gained exposure to the database, MongoDB, before learning more about databases in the future. So enter a message below. Who knows? Someone might respond to it.</p>

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center">I currently do not have any work experience to display on my portfolio, due to the fact that I've been focused on my studies and I was never able to gain an internship during my college career. Probably not a good reason to never have work experience up until this point, but it is what it is.</p>
